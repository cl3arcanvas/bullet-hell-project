# Shade

Enjoy Shade, a project created for my County's Tech Fair. 
In this game, you are a unnamed mage, fighting through a horde of corrupted enemies in a snowy wasteland in order to finish off the end boss and cleanse the world of the corruption.

There is only windows version for the pre-modifications, but you should be able to run the game on Mac Or Linux using Wine. I have tested the game on Linux, but I can't be 100% sure for Mac.
For the Post-Modifications, I have provided builds for Mac, Windows, and Linux. I have also made my Github repository public, so anyone can view the code.
All Downloads from itch.io are labeled by the platform and whether it was Post-Modification or Pre-Modification,
